Compiling and Running Program:

	There are no special instructions necessary for compiling this
project's code as it was all done in python. This program should be invoked on
the command line in the following way:

		python group8_project1.py <name_of_file.txt>

	If the assignment/project requirements are correct then <name_of_file.txt> will
be MSS_Problems.txt. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Unpacking/Unzipping Program:

	There are 5 individual python files that implement all the details and 
requirements of this project. The files are as follows:
	
		enumeration.py
		better_enum.py
		divide_conquer.py
		linear_time.py
		group8_project1.py

	All of these files should be present after unpacking/unzipping the project. 
Please make sure that all 5 of these files are in the current working directory
when invoking the command to run the program that was mentioned earlier.
